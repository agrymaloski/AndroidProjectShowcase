# Android Project Showcase: Ninja Activities

Welcome to my Android Project showcase! This project integrates a variety of fun and exciting features that blend the world of Ninjas with some modern applications. Here's what you can expect:

## Features

1. Random Photo Generator
Generate a random photo of your desired category (ex. nature, food etc) with a random photo generator. Each time you use this feature, a new and unique photo of the specified category is fetched using API Ninja's (https://api-ninjas.com/api/randomimage).


## 2. Calorie Activity Generator
Curious about what activities burn the most calories? Use the calorie activity generator to see how many calories each activity burns! This information is generated using the API Ninja's (https://api-ninjas.com/api/caloriesburned)

Example:

inputted activity key word = "running"

example response = 
[
  {
    "name": "Walk/run, playing with children, moderate",
    "calories_per_hour": 290,
    "duration_minutes": 60,
    "total_calories": 290
  },
  {
    "name": "Walk/run, playing with children, vigorous",
    "calories_per_hour": 363,
    "duration_minutes": 60,
    "total_calories": 363
  },

  }
]
